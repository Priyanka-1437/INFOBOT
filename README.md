# INFOBOT
A web-based chatbot application built with Python, Flask, and machine learning. Uses NLP to process user input and deliver real-time responses through a clean browser interface.
This project is a web-based chatbot built using Python and Flask. It processes user input through an NLP-based logic engine to deliver intelligent, human-like responses in real-time via a browser interface.

The backend uses a modular design where conversation logic is separated from the web application, making it clean and easy to maintain. The chatbot is ideal for learning purposes, prototyping customer support bots, or as a foundation for more complex AI systems.
